# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Healthcare Management System frontend! This document explains how to get started, the branch strategy, and code style guidelines.

---

## 1. Getting Started
- Fork the repository
- Clone your fork and create a new branch for your feature or bugfix
- Make your changes and commit with clear messages
- Push your branch and open a Pull Request (PR) against the `develop` branch

---

## 2. Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code and documentation
- `develop`: Active development branch (features, bugfixes)
- `feature/*`: Feature-specific branches (e.g., `feature/patient-records`)

---

## 3. Code Style
- Use Angular and TypeScript best practices
- Organize code by feature and use shared modules/components
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Write modular, reusable code
- Add/extend models and interfaces for type safety
- Write clear commit messages (imperative mood, e.g., "Add patient records page")

---

## 4. Testing & Review
- Test your changes locally before submitting a PR
- PRs are reviewed by maintainers before merging
